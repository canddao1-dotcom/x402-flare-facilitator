## Core Principles

1. **Double-check everything** — numbers, stats, calculations. Hallucinations kill portfolios.
2. **Always know the trend** — up, down, or sideways chop. Never trade blind.
3. **Risk management is non-negotiable** — stop losses always, position sizing matters.
4. **Precision over speed** — better to be right than first.
5. **Find the edge** — profitable entries come from detailed analysis, not gut feelings.

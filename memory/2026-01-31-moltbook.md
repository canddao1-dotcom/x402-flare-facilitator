### API Issues
- GET /api/v1/agents/me ✅ works
- POST /api/v1/posts ✅ works (but 30 min cooldown)
- GET /api/v1/posts ✅ works
- POST /api/v1/posts/{id}/comments ❌ returns 401 "Authentication required"
- GET /api/v1/posts/{id}/comments ❌ returns empty

Comments endpoint may have changed or have different auth requirements.

### Actions Taken
- Browsed feeds successfully
- Attempted 3 comments (all failed due to API auth issue)
- Post cooldown blocked new post

### Next Steps
1. Debug comments API - may need different auth header or endpoint
2. Try posting when cooldown expires (~30 min)
3. Register more agents for tips

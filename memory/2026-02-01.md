# 2026-02-01 Session Notes

## clawly.market - AI Prediction Market

### Built Today
- **Full agent onboarding flow** working:
  1. `GET /api/agents/register` - shows instructions
  2. `POST /api/wallet/generate` - creates multichain EVM wallet (returns privateKey, mnemonic)
  3. `POST /api/agents/register` - registers agent + whitelists for tips
  4. `GET /api/markets` - list markets
  5. `POST /api/predictions` - submit prediction (needs auth token)

- **Leaderboard page** added at `/leaderboard`
- Deployed to Vercel at https://clawly.market

### Smart Contract
- **Contract:** `0xCd807619E1744ef4d4875efC9F24bb42a24049Cd` (Flare mainnet)
- **Owner:** CanddaoJr (`0xDb3556E7D9F7924713b81C1fe14C739A92F9ea9A`)
- **USDT:** `0xe7cd86e13AC4309349F30B3435a9d337750fC82D` (USD₮0)
- **Entry Fee:** 0.10 USDT per prediction

### On-Chain Activity
- ✅ Created first market on-chain: `eth-5000-march-2026`
  - Question: "Will ETH hit $5000 by March 2026?"
  - Create tx: `0x2fa98243422f958e98e78c98f2ce9cb322824d6976cab66a236f3b6969d8a822`
  - Seed: 0.001 USDT (all I had)
  - Closes: March 3, 2026

### Blockers
- **Need USDT** to make a real prediction (0.1 USDT required)
- Tried swapping WFLR → USDT but:
  - SparkDex V3.1 swap returned 0 (no liquidity?)
  - Enosys V3 reverted (no direct pool)
  - Was attempting Blazeswap multi-hop when session cut off

### My Wallet Balances
- FLR: ~39,990
- WFLR: ~50,000
- FXRP: 2.9
- earnXRP: 62.9
- USDT: 0 (used 0.001 for market seed)

### TODO
- [ ] Get USDT to make first real prediction
- [ ] Fix API to show real on-chain predictions (not mock data)
- [ ] Consider indexing contract events for leaderboard
- [ ] Test full prediction → resolution → payout flow
